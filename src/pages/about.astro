      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="hero-description">
        Hands-on design leader with 15+ years of experience building human-centered
        organizations that create human-centered products.

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I believe exceptional products come from exceptional teams. As a hands-on design
        leader, I build the psychological safety, inclusive collaboration, and technical
        excellence that enables breakthrough user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most design leaders choose between strategic thinking and hands-on craft. I do both.
        I can open Figma and solve your technical problem in the morning, then facilitate a
        cross-functional alignment session in the afternoon.
      </p>

      <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        My approach is grounded in a simple belief: innovation starts with dialogue.
        The same empathy we apply to user research must extend to team collaboration.
      </p>
      <h3>The Three Pillars</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychological Safety</strong> — The foundation for technical innovation. Teams that feel safe take creative risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Participation</strong> — Different minds need different systems. Designing collaboration for cognitive diversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialogue-Based Change</strong> — Transformation through conversation, not command. Sustainable change comes from understanding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in <strong>privacy-first design</strong>—creating exceptional user
        experiences without traditional analytics dependency. Proven across 4+ companies
        with alternative validation methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't a limitation; it's a strategic advantage. Privacy-first design is
        increasingly valuable as GDPR+ regulations expand globally, and my methodology
        succeeds in regulated environments like finance, healthcare, and religious data.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently Head of Product Design at Bibel TV, while continuing to teach and study:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bibel TV</strong> — Head of Product Design, establishing a design system and redesigning apps for mobile and TV ecosystems with an AI-first design and prototype process</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Driven Prototyping Trainings</strong> — Teaching teams to leverage AI tools for faster design-to-prototype workflows</li>
        <li><strong>Masters in Leadership</strong> — Formalizing my leadership philosophy through academic study</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let's Talk</h2>

        I'm based in Berlin, Germany.
