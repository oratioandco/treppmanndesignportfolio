      <p class="hero-tagline">AI-First Design Process</p>
      <p class="hero-description">
        AI doesn't replace design thinking—it compresses the path from idea to
        testable prototype. I've developed an AI-first design process and now
        teach teams how to do the same.

      <h2>The Shift</h2>
      <p>
        Design used to have a handoff problem. Designers created static mockups,
        then waited for engineering to build something testable. Feedback loops
        were slow. Ideas died in the gap between vision and implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Zed have changed this. Designers
        can now go from concept to functional prototype in hours, not weeks. But
        most teams don't know how to integrate these tools into their process
        without losing design quality.
      </p>

      <h2>My Approach: AI-First Design</h2>
      <p>
        AI-first doesn't mean AI-only. It means using AI to accelerate the parts
        of design that benefit from speed, while protecting the parts that require
        human judgment.
      </p>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Rapid Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
            Use AI to generate functional prototypes early. Test with real interactions,
            not static screens. Fail faster, learn faster.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Design Decisions Stay Human</h4>
          <p>
            AI generates options. Humans choose direction. The craft of design—understanding
            users, making trade-offs, maintaining coherence—remains fundamentally human work.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Iteration Over Perfection</h4>
          <p>
            When prototypes are cheap to create, you can explore more ideas. The goal
            shifts from "get it right the first time" to "learn what right looks like."

      <h2>Applied at Bibel TV</h2>
      <p>
        As Head of Product Design at Bibel TV, I'm applying this approach to redesign
        apps across mobile and TV ecosystems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design System with AI</strong> — Establishing a design system while using AI to accelerate component development and documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform Prototyping</strong> — Testing interactions on mobile, tablet, and TV before committing to full implementation</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Stakeholder Alignment</strong> — Showing working prototypes instead of explaining static mockups</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result: tighter feedback loops, more exploration, and better final products.
      </p>

      <h2>Teaching Others</h2>
      <p>
        I now lead trainings helping design teams adopt AI-first workflows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hands-On Workshops</strong> — Designers leave with working prototypes, not just theory</li>
        <li><strong>Tool Selection</strong> — Claude Code for complex logic, Zed/VSCode for quick iterations, when to use what</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Control</strong> — How to maintain design standards when AI is generating code</li>
        <li><strong>Team Integration</strong> — How AI-first design changes the designer-engineer relationship</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <div class="star-story">
        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement</h4>
          <p>
            The designers who thrive with AI are the ones with strong fundamentals.
            AI amplifies skill—it doesn't substitute for it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Speed Enables Quality</h4>
          <p>
            Counterintuitively, faster prototyping leads to better designs. You can
            test more ideas, catch problems earlier, and refine based on real feedback.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Stay Skeptical, Stay Current</h4>
          <p>
            AI tools evolve weekly. What works today may be obsolete tomorrow. The
            skill is learning how to learn, not mastering any single tool.
