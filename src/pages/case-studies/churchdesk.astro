      <p class="hero-description">
        Designing a deceptively simple booking experience that masks extraordinary
        complexity—multiple stakeholders, rotating schedules, cemetery opening hours,
        and the emotional weight of funeral planning.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Funeral homes need to coordinate with churches to book a priest for funeral services.
        This coordination—between funeral home, parish office, and priest—requires extensive
        back-and-forth communication. For bereaved families, every additional phone call
        adds to an already draining experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complexity runs deep: priests take turns on-call but have preferences or
        commitments to specific cemeteries. Teams of priests plan their availability
        6 weeks into the future. Each cemetery has different opening hours. And beyond
        funerals, ChurchDesk wanted to cover more booking use cases like room rentals.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Three stakeholder groups: Funeral homes need instant visibility and quick responses. Parish assistants need to give competent information and manage priest vacancies. Priests need more predictability and control over their schedules.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>The Design Tension</h2>
      <p>
        We faced a fundamental UX paradox:
      </p>
      <div class="star-story">
        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>For Funeral Homes</h4>
          <p>
            Should feel like booking a priest—simple, fast, reliable. Select a time,
            get confirmation, done.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>For Priests</h4>
          <p>
            Should NOT feel like being booked. Maintain autonomy and control over
            their own schedules. Service mentality, not service industry.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        These opposing needs required careful system design to satisfy both perspectives
        simultaneously.
      </p>

        <figcaption>The endless phone calls have come to an end</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>The Solution Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        ChurchDesk already had a calendar with people and resource association for events.
        We extended this foundation with a new concept:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Availability as Event Type</strong> — A new event type that could be associated with booking pages</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Option Availability</strong> — Priests could make themselves available for multiple booking options (e.g., different cemeteries) in one action</li>
        <li><strong>Recurring Events Integration</strong> — Leveraged existing recurring events for simple on-call schedule creation</li>
        <li><strong>Cemetery Hours Overlay</strong> — Each cemetery's opening hours factored into availability calculation</li>
        <li><strong>Request-Based Booking</strong> — Bookings presented as requests/enquiries that priests confirm or reject</li>
      </ul>

      <figure class="case-study-image">
        <img src="/images/churchdesk/page-05.png" alt="System architecture" />
        <figcaption>Simple yet complex: Individual availability schedules, 6-week advance planning, multiple cemeteries with different funeral times</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="case-study-image">
        <img src="/images/churchdesk/page-06.png" alt="Availability model" />
        <figcaption>Simple for priests: Set availability for multiple cemeteries at once, automatic funeral time handling, seamless calendar integration, email notifications, and manual confirmation control</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Complexity Made Simple</h2>
      <p>
        The result: end-users (funeral homes) got a simple booking experience. Priests got
        simple availability management—especially powerful with recurring events. And everyone
        maintained appropriate control and visibility.
      </p>

      <figure class="case-study-image">
        <img src="/images/churchdesk/page-07.png" alt="Interface design" />
        <figcaption>Simple for parish assistants: Easy overview of on-call schedules, ability to set availability for priests</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        Built on React (web) with React Native components for mobile, extending ChurchDesk's
        existing platform:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calendar System Extension</strong> — New availability event type integrated with existing calendar infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Booking Page Generator</strong> — Dynamic pages based on availability and cemetery constraints</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Filtering</strong> — Automatic matching of priest preferences to cemetery requirements</li>
        <li><strong>GDPR+ Compliance</strong> — Privacy-first design for sensitive personal and religious data</li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>Simple for funeral homes: Only actually available times are shown, digital processing enables quick responses</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="case-study-image">
        <img src="/images/churchdesk/page-09.png" alt="Final solution" />
        <figcaption>The entire process automated and in one place</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
      <div class="star-story">
        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Request vs. Booking Language</h4>
          <p>
            To preserve priest autonomy, we framed all bookings as "requests" or "enquiries"
            that require confirmation. This small language shift maintained the service
            mentality while giving priests genuine control.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Unified Availability Model</h4>
          <p>
            Rather than building separate systems for funerals, room rentals, and other use cases,
            we designed a flexible availability model that scales to any booking scenario—a
            platform investment, not just a feature.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="star-item">
          <h4>Progressive Disclosure</h4>
          <p>
            Funeral homes see only what they need: available times. The underlying complexity
            of rotating schedules, cemetery hours, and priest preferences stays invisible.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Coordination time dropped from days of phone calls to minutes. The system achieved
        high acceptance rates through smart filtering that only showed genuinely available
        options. Most importantly, it became a core platform feature—the availability/booking
        model now powers use cases far beyond the original funeral scheduling need.
